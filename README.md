# 🎙️ Coughometer – Deep Learning Based Cough Sound Classifier

Coughometer is a personal project designed to give me **hands-on experience in building and deploying a complete ML/DL pipeline**.  
It classifies cough sounds using a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** model and is deployed with **FastAPI, Docker, and Render**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 Upload or record **.wav cough audio files**  
- 🧠 **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** for classification  
- 🌐 Backend powered by **FastAPI**  
- 🐳 Containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **Render**  
- 📊 End-to-end ML system: preprocessing → model inference → API → frontend
